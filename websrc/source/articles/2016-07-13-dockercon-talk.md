# Dockercon'16 - Enabling Container Applications in Production - Now Online



4000 attendees at Dockercon last month was a great proof that more and more customers are considering containers and microservices architecture for future cloud native applications.   I was there along with rest of the Contiv team talking about how Contiv provide ability to specify and enforce run time container application characteristics to allow for predictable performance in a shared enterprise infrastructure.   We are extremely happy with the response and follow-up from the attendees.   If you missed my talk, you can find it below.
